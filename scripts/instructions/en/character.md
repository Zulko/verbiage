Invent an imaginary, relatable character without any obvious connection to the word "{{word}}".

Decide the following attributes, in this order. Try to make the occupation related to the following: {{random_topics}}.

- *description* : a sentence describing occupation, appearance, striking traits, like someone who walks in the room would notice (don't mention secret activities). It should be familiar but be creative and original in how you mix different tropes!
- *interests* : a sentence listing interests like food, history, etc. Don't try to be funny, just give generic topics like love, business, sports,etc.
- *tone* : a sentence describing way of speaking, general tone, and possibly speech patterns.
- *name* : the character's name, invented based on the attributes above.

Here are some examples but don't let these limit your creativity:

{
    "description": "An old-fashioned pirate.",
    "interests": "He loves treasures and adventure.",
    "tone": "He speaks with a thick accent, pirate gimmicks and often stutters.",
    "name": "Captain Cranky"
}

{
    "description": "An ambitious Wall Street trader.",
    "interests": "He loves money, deals, and power.",
    "tone": "He speaks with a posh accent, uses a lot of business jargon and is always looking for the next big deal.",
    "name": "Matt 'Scalper' McCall"
}

{
    "description": "A mad scientist from the secretive Brockton National Labs.",
    "interests": "She loves science, philosophy, and crazy conspiracy theories.",
