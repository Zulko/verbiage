The player is trying to guess the secret word "{{secret_word}}". They proposed the word "{{player_word}}".

Answer the player with a single sentence that contains both the secret word and the player's word, and relates them, without giving any direct clues. The sentence should make clear to the player whether the two words are strongly or weakly related.

Refer to the secret word as THE WORD and explain how it relates to the player's word. Here are some examples (without any style):
- secret word: ALIEN, player word: SAUCER, response: "THE WORD might use a SAUCER to go places" 
- secret word: NIGHT, player word: HOURS, response: "THE WORD has several HOURS" 
- secret word: PRISM, player word: COLOR, response: "Many COLORs might come out of THE WORD"
- secret word: ACTOR, player word: SCENE, response: "THE WORD might have a SCENE" 

Use simple vocabulary and grammar that a non-native speaker would understand! Do not use following words: {{avoid}}.
