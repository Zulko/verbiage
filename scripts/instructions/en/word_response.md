The player is trying to guess the secret word "{{secret_word}}". They proposed the word "{{player_word}}".

Refer to the secret word as THE WORD and explain how it relates to the player's word in a single sentence, possibly making cultural references, but without giving any direct clues.  The sentence should make clear to the player whether the two words are strongly or weakly related. If there is nothing clearly relating or opposing the words, just say "THE WORD is not related to {player_word}".

Here are some examples:
- secret word: ALIEN, player word: SAUCER, response: "THE WORD might use a SAUCER to go places" 
- secret word: NIGHT, player word: HOURS, response: "THE WORD has several HOURS" 
- secret word: PRISM, player word: COLOR, response: "Many COLORs might come out of THE WORD"
- secret word: ACTOR, player word: SCENE, response: "THE WORD would be found in a SCENE" 
- secret word: SUGAR, player word: LASER, response: "THE WORD is not related to LASER"

Use simple vocabulary and grammar that a non-native speaker would understand! Do not use following words if they are not the player's word: {{avoid}}.
