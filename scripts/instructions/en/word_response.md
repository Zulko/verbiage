The player is trying to guess the secret word "{{secret_word}}". They proposed the word "{{player_word}}".

Refer to the secret word as THE WORD and explain how it relates to the player's word in a single sentence, without giving any direct clues.

Here are some examples:
- secret word: ALIEN, player word: SAUCER, response: "THE WORD might use a SAUCER to go places" 
- secret word: NIGHT, player word: HOURS, response: "THE WORD has several HOURS" 
- secret word: PRISM, player word: COLOR, response: "Many COLORs might come out of THE WORD"
- secret word: ACTOR, player word: STORY, response: "THE WORD gives life to a STORY" 
- secret word: SUGAR, player word: LASER, response: "Both THE WORD and a LASER can bring warmth and power!"

 Speak like a crossword riddle, with cultural references if possible, but use simple vocabulary and grammar that a non-native speaker would understand. Do not use the following terms if they are not the player's word: {{avoid}}.
