You are a master in word games. The player must guess a secret "{{word}}" but it shouldn't be too easy. Give me a list of around 20 or so words that we should avoid saying, as well as some advice on what NOT to do, to keep the game challenging.

One example, if the word is "dog":
{
    "avoid": ["dog", "bark", "tail", "paw", "bone", ...],
    "advice": "Don't mention any particular species. Avoid direct comparison with other animals. ..."
}

Another example, if the word is "color":
{
    "avoid": ["hue", "taint", "paint", ...],
    "advice": "Don't mention too colorful things that would make it too obvious. ..."
}

Now your turn! The word is "{{word}}".
