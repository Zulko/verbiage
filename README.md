# Verbiage

Verbiage is a word guessing game. When you guess the wrong word, you get a clue about how your guess relates to the secret word.

This repository is organized in two folders:

- `scripts` contains the scripts for generating the word lists and clues, and generating the daily puzzles.
- `verbiage` contains the code for the app.
